This is a Java implementation of Prims Algorithm for finding the minimum spanning tree.

You need to specify the graph using a .txt file.

Taking an example of a very basic graph .
For example , you have a graph of 3 nodes - A,B,C where all the nodes are connected to one another.
And this is a undirected graph. Then you will represent the graph as follows - 

undirected
3
A
B
C
A B
A C
B C

The code will automatically create a Adjacency List data structure representing the given graph.
If the graph is directed , then you can specify it by writing 'directed' as the first line of the text file.
I am placing a sample graph.txt file in the repository for your reference.

This java code generates the minimum spanning tree for any given graph.
